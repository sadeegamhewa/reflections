* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It marks the directory as a git directory for tracking.

* Which file(s) will you add?

I will add reflections 1 file to staging.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to create logical groups of commits by putting files that are
ready to be committed to staging and pushing them together.
