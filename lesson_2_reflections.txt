* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It marks the directory as a git directory for tracking.

* Which file(s) will you add?

I will add reflections 1 file to staging.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to create logical groups of commits by putting files that are
ready to be committed to staging and pushing them together.

* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
  change?

You add files required for a logical change to the staging area with git add
then commit those changes together from staging to repo.

* What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

When you are making experimental changes, you want to create a branch and do
the changes and ask them to be merged to master when it's ready.

* How do the diagrams help to visualize the branch structure?

It helps to get an understanding of the structure.

* What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it
in the diagram the way we do?

Changes from both branches are in the latest commit. That way we can see when
the branches were created and when they were merged.

* What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs always doing merges
manually?

Helps when the changes are obvious - saves time. Manual is good for cases that
git is not sure so that it doesn't go and do merges it shouldn't.
